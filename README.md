# Python_Advance_Projects

I have worked on a few advance projects in python , that's included some programs such as ;
Handwritten digit recognition , music player ,whatsappBot and   Create-GUI-App-Using-Python-Selenium-and-Tkinter-main.

Run the following programs and do some changes if necessary , then commit here as well

I created one more program , that's all about automation.
It means automating the social sites , such LinkedIn , Facebook , Google , Instagram and Twitter.
For those social Media's sites , I used the GUI and selenium library for automation , that's working 100% well.

But I tried to make a web base application this automation using streamlit library.
# Run
Run the following code in GUI as well as in Streamlit, and check the following errors in streamlit file.
If you do some changes , then commit here.
I'll love to see your kindess.
thank you‚ù§
